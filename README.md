## News Stand

> The goal of News Stand is to provide users a clean, all-in-one place to find, consume, and comment on the news. News sites are fragmented and RSS feeds donâ€™t allow users to comment, so we want to combine the two.

> Our project is built using the MERN stack.

## Usage

From the command line, run the following commands:

Clone:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/news-stand/news_stand
```

Navigate Into Repo:
```sh
cd news_stand
```

Install Dependencies:
```sh
npm install
```


Start:
```sh
npm run start:dev
```
Note: This starts the Webpack bundler and Babel transpiler, which run in parallel with nodemon to run your server. You only need one open "running" terminal, rather than three. All three will watch for changes, so you don't need to re-run or re-start any of the processes.

- node 8.4.0
- express 
- body-parser
- mongodb
- mongoose
